"""Markdown prose reflowed by hand at a fixed column.

Editors, diff views and every renderer wrap on their own, so a hand-wrapped
paragraph buys nothing and costs every later edit: changing one word reflows
lines that did not change, and the diff shows a paragraph rewritten instead of
a word. Tree-sitter discards the line breaks this depends on, so the check
cannot be an ast-grep rule.

A paragraph is called hand-wrapped when its lines sit in a narrow band of
widths and every break is forced: the first word of the next line could not
have fitted on the line before it. A break that was not forced is a deliberate
one (one clause per line, a sentence per line) and takes the whole paragraph
out of scope.
