"""agent-guard tool-check: a path read relative to a `cd` in the same command.

The permission analyzer resolves a command's file operands against the session's
working directory, not against a `cd` earlier in the same compound command. With
any Read() deny rule configured it cannot prove the unresolved path misses the
denied set, so `cd DIR && rg PAT relfile` stops and waits for a human every time.
The absolute form of the same read carries no such cost.

Fires only when the command after the `cd` is a file reader, so the `cd` exists
purely to shorten the path. A build or a test runner genuinely needs its working
directory and is left alone.
