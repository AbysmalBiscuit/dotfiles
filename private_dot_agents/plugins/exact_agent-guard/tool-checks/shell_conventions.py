"""PreToolUse/Bash guard: the shell commands AGENTS.md rules out.

Two families, both denied rather than advised, because each has an exact
mechanical replacement and a suggestion an agent can skip is one it will skip:

  legacy search tools   find, grep over files, ls -R, the sg alias, and the
                        pipelines that chain two tools where one already does
                        the whole job
  git stash             parallel agents share the working tree, so stashing
                        pulls the ground out from under a session that never
                        agreed to it

Denials are computed from the command as parsed, so the reason can name the
replacement rather than restate the rule. Anything that will not parse is let
through: refusing work over a quoting edge case teaches agents to route around
the hook, and the cost of a missed `grep` is one line of output.

`grep` reading a stream is left alone. `ps aux | grep sshd` is not a search of
file contents and rewriting it buys nothing; the rule is about searching the
filesystem, so it fires on -r and on a file operand.

The `rg -r<flags>` footgun has a hook of its own and is deliberately absent here.
