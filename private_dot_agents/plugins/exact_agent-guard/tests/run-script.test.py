"""Cases for run_script in scripts/agent-guard.py. Run directly: python3 <this file>.

run_script executes a check inside the runner's own interpreter instead of
spawning a Python for it. That buys roughly a 4x speedup on a Bash call and
nothing else, so every case here asks the same question: does the check observe
what a subprocess would have given it, and does the runner observe what a
subprocess would have returned?

Four layers:

  parity      each fixture, and each shipped tool-check, run both ways and
              diffed against the real subprocess rather than against a
              hand-written expectation
  delivery    argv, stdin, cwd, stderr and a sibling import, which a subprocess
              provides for free and this path has to reproduce deliberately
  isolation   what a shared interpreter can leak that separate processes could
              not: a check's imports, its edits to sys.argv/sys.path/cwd, and a
              helper of the same name in another root
  mutation    the cases have teeth: breaking run_script must break the suite

Subprocess results are captured once and replayed, so the mutants are compared
against an oracle none of them can reach.
