"""Cases for checks/comment_length.py. Run directly: python3 <this file>.

The cases that matter separate a paragraph from a single sentence that wrapped,
since a check firing on the second teaches agents to skim past the first. Two
of them drive the real hook end to end, one asserting a violation reaches the
agent and one that a note arrives under a heading that does not call it one.
