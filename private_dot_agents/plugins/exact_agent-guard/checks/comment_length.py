"""Comments longer than the conventions allow, in every language a tree holds.

AGENTS.md: if you need a paragraph-long comment to justify why the workaround is
OK, the code is wrong. A paragraph is a multi-sentence unit, so sentences are
what this counts, with a line ceiling behind them and a character ceiling for
the single sentence that rambles. Counting lines alone measures the file's wrap
width: in a real tree the median three-line comment is one sentence that did not
fit, and half of them are `====` section banners.

An ast-grep rule cannot reach any of this. Tree-sitter gives each `//` line a
comment node of its own, so a rule over one node's text never sees the run.

Doc comments keep a far looser budget. `/** */`, `///` and `//!` are written for
a caller who never opens the file, not narration of the code beside them. A
Python docstring is a string literal rather than a comment, so it arrives from
the parser instead of the scanner and answers to the same budget.

Line numbers are what the runner filters on when scope is "diff", so a span is
reported on its last line: a comment an agent grows by appending has its old
first line and its new last one.
