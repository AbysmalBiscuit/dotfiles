A rule maps the text to catch, pasted as itself, to what to write instead, and
"" to delete it. Wrap the value in Explain when a swap cannot carry the advice.
The dict a rule sits in is its severity, and matching ignores case. Only what a
call adds is read, and an agent editing these rules is refused, so they stay
